# Gym Application
## Introduction
For our Professional Skills In I.T Module, we created an application for a gym that users can join using their email address, view the fitness classes schedule, book a personal training session and also purchase protein drinks, energy bars, etc. We chose to create this app to learn more about how React, FireBase and PayPal are implemented in websites.
